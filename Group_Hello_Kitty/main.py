    "A stunningly beautiful Malay princess stands alone in a quiet forest during golden hour, her long dark hair flowing gently in the breeze. Her refined facial features are elegant and noble, with expressive eyes that glow in the soft backlight. She wears a full-length traditional royal Malay dress made of layered songket fabric with intricate golden embroidery and long sleeves. A translucent kain lepas flows from her shoulders, trailing softly in the wind. Her accessories include a fine golden pendant, subtle earrings, and a royal crest brooch. She stands with grace and quiet strength, her face serene and composed. The background is inspired by Makoto Shinkai‚Äôs cinematic lighting, with sunrays filtering through tall tropical trees. Highly detailed, soft lighting, clean anime-style linework.",
